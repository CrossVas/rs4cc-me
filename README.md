# Refined Storage for ComputerCraft [![](http://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/432182.svg)](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/refined-storage-for-computercraft) [![](http://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/versions/432182.svg)](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/refined-storage-for-computercraft)

**Provides a new _Refined Storage Peripheral_ block that can interface as a peripheral to ComputerCraft or CC: Tweaked computers and turtles (either directly or via modem).**

This peripheral allows you to perform queries about the contents of your RS system (items, fluids, and crafting patterns for both), start new crafting tasks, query or cancel existing crafting tasks, and even to extract items/fluids to an adjacent inventory/tank.

It is based on (and mostly compatible with) the OpenComputers API that was implemented in MC1.12, so programs using it should not require many changes.
