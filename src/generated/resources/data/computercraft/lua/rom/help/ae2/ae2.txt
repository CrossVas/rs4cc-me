The ae2 API is only available when an ME Peripheral is attached to the computer at startup.  This assumes that you only have one such peripheral attached.
Note that the global API may misbehave if you move the Peripheral block while the computer is running.  To recover from this, just restart the computer by holding Ctrl+R or reloading your save.

If you do want to interact with multiple separate systems (e.g. a subnetwork), then you should use "peripheral.wrap" as normal, which will provide the same API.

Functions in the ae2 API:
ae2.isConnected() => boolean
ae2.getEnergyUsage() => number
ae2.getEnergyStorage() => number
ae2.getInventory() => table
ae2.getItems([table stack]) => table
ae2.getFluids([table stack]) => table
ae2.getItem(table stack, [boolean compareNBT = true], [boolean evenIfZero = false]) => table
ae2.getFluid(table stack, [boolean compareNBT = true], [boolean evenIfZero = false]) => table
ae2.getCraftingCPUs() => table
ae2.getPatterns(table stack) => table
ae2.scheduleTask(table stack, [number count = stack.count = 1], [boolean canSchedule = true], [string preferredCpu = nil]) => table
ae2.extractItem(table stack, [number count = stack.count = 1], [string/number direction = "down"]) => number
ae2.extractFluid(table stack, [number amount = stack.amount = 1000], [string/number direction = "down"]) => number
