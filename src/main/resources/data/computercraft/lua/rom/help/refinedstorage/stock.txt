The 'stock' program manages the list of items to be stocked by the 'autostock' program (see "help autostock").

Syntax: stock [raw] [command args...]

If the "raw" option is specified then it will both print and expect raw internal item names rather than the normal human-readable names.  This is slightly faster but less user-friendly.
Otherwise, it will display normal names and you can enter either raw or normal names.
Items with NBT tags are only supported if you use its normal name.
Note that if you're playing on a server, only the names in the language of the server will work, not your local names, due to the way that computers work.

Commands:
  - list           : displays the current list of stocked items
  - refresh        : displays how often it checks for changes in stock
  - refresh N      : changes the refresh rate to N seconds
  - item           : displays the current list of stocked items
  - item "NAME" N  : changes or adds NAME to be stocked to N items
  - fluid          : displays the current list of stocked fluids
  - fluid "NAME" N : changes or adds NAME to be stocked to N buckets
  - delete N       : deletes the stock request for the Nth item (see the list)
  - move A B       : moves item #A to position #B
  - start          : starts the autostock program (in the background, if possible)

If no command is specified then it runs "list" by default.

For a dedicated autostock computer, you will probably want to "edit startup" and then write this:
    os.run("stock", "start")
